				<h1>Interests</h1>
				<p>
					<b>Roller Coasters</b> I have always been interested in theme parks and roller coasters. I have gone to an extensive number of amusement and theme parks around the country. Check out my <a href="Documents/Roller Coaster Journal.pdf" download> Roller Coaster Journel</a> to see which parks and which roller coasters I have ridden. <br/> <br/>

					<b>Astronomy</b> The cosmos, the stars, and the constellations are an interest of mine. Serving as Astronomy Club President for two terms, I was able to have access the Oakley Observatory at Rose-Hulman and use the telescopes there. I am not president anymore, but I occasionally enjoy looking at the night sky.<br/> <br/>

					<b>Running 5k's</b> I try to exercise and work out to keep in shape as well as for entertainment. If there is a local 5k in town, I will race in it. I am not the best runner, but I do run.
