				<p>
					<b>Fun Face Cam</b> I worked on a simple BeagleBone project that allows the user to take a picture and add a mustache, hat, or sunglasses to their face. <a href="http://elinux.org/ECE_497_Project_-_Fun_Face_Cam">Click here for more details</a>.<br/> <br/>

					<b>LED Cube</b> I also built a 4x4x4 led cube. The led cube had a coin acceptor attached to it on the side. The user would pay a quarter, select a led show, and watch the LED show on the cube.<br/> <br/>


					<b>Python to VHDL</b> Currently, there is a function in Simulink that converts a circuit into VHDL. A company has asked my team to see if Python could be used instead. The attempt is to find a way to take Python and sucessfully convert it to VHDL. I am currently working on this project.<br/> <br/>

					<b>JoJo</b> At the end of high school (when I was a lot younger), I attempted to make a small fun animatronic. Using an Arduino, servo motors, and a few sensors, I tried to make the animatronic react to people. I hope to come back to this project an improve it. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r44fZrRolhA">Click here for a video</a>.<br/> <br/><br/>
